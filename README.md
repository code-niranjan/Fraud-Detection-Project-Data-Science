Key Features:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, skewness, and multicollinearity.

Feature Engineering: Derived dest_balance_change and encoded categorical variables.

Imbalanced Data Handling: Applied resampling techniques to address rare fraud cases.

Models Used: Random Forest, XGBoost, and an Ensemble model for better accuracy and recall.

Results: Ensemble model achieved 94% recall and 72% precision, effectively detecting fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

Tools & Libraries:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

This project highlights practical techniques for fraud detection, feature selection, and model evaluation.
